In this paper, we explore how programming assistants can be extended to accelerate the inspection of generated code. We introduce an extension to the programming assistant called Ivie, or instantly visible in-situ explanations. When using Ivie, a programmer's generated code is instantly accompanied by explanations positioned just adjacent to the code. Our design was optimized for extremely low-cost invocation and dismissal. Explanations are compact and informative. They describe meaningful expressions, from individual variables to entire blocks of code. We present an implementation of Ivie that forks VS Code, applying a modern LLM for timely segmentation and explanation of generated code.

Unfortunately, existing frameworks and languages (e.g., SQL, Flink, Spark) entail significant code complexity and expert effort to express such stateful analytics because of their dynamic and stateful nature. Our overarching goal is to simplify and democratize stateful analytics.

We then conducted three real-world case studies of SEAM-EZ with 20 additional practitioners.

While data-driven solutions achieve higher accuracy, they rely on extensive human datasets so prove costly, time-consuming, and transfer poorly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages biomechanical simulation to produce synthetic motion data, capturing a variety of movement-related factors, such as limb configurations and motor noise.

To assist novice users in prompting, PromptCharm first automatically refines and optimizes the user‚Äôs initial prompt. Furthermore, PromptCharm supports the user in exploring and selecting different image styles within a large database. To assist users in effectively refining their prompts and images, PromptCharm renders model explanations by visualizing the model‚Äôs attention values. If the user notices any unsatisfactory areas in the generated images, they can further refine the images through model attention adjustment or image inpainting within the rich feedback loop of PromptCharm.

This paper focuses on transitioning such individuals to more independent, digital spelling that requires less support from the CRP, a goal most nonspeakers we consulted with desire. To enable this transition, we followed an approach that mimics an environment familiar to the nonspeaker and that harnesses the skills they already possess from physical letterboard training. Using this approach, we developed HoloBoard, a system that allows a nonspeaker, their CRP, and others, e.g., researchers, to share a common Augmented Reality (AR) environment containing a virtual letterboard. We configured the system to offer a brief (less than 10 minutes, on average) training module with graduated spelling tasks on the virtual letterboard.

When offered the opportunity to continue interacting with the virtual letterboard after the training module, 14 performed more complicated tasks than we had anticipated, spelling full sentences, or even offering feedback on the HoloBoard using solely the virtual board.

In this work, we aim to address this research and empirical gap by systematically exploring how task complexity and uncertainty influence human-AI decision-making. Task complexity refers to the load of information associated with a task, while task uncertainty refers to the level of unpredictability associated with the outcome of a task. We conducted a between-subjects user study (N = 258) in the context of a trip-planning task to investigate the impact of task complexity and uncertainty on human trust and reliance on AI systems. Our results revealed that task complexity and uncertainty have a significant impact on user reliance on AI systems. When presented with complex and uncertain tasks, users tended to rely more on AI systems while demonstrating lower levels of appropriate reliance compared to tasks that were less complex and uncertain. In contrast, we found that user trust in the AI systems was not influenced by task complexity and uncertainty. Our findings can help inform the future design of empirical studies exploring human-AI decision-making.
