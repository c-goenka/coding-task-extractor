Across two online between-subjects studies, we paired crowd- workers either with one another or with an LLM, asking senders (always humans) to communicate IPTs in natural language to their receiver (either a human or LLM). Both senders and receivers tried to answer test cases, the latter based on their sender’s descrip­ tion.

However, plan-focused pedagogies are rarely used beyond introductory programming. Our formative study (N=10 educators) showed that identifying plans is a tedious process. To advance plan-focused pedagogies in application-focused domains, we created an LLM-powered pipeline that automates the efortful parts of educators’ plan identifcation process by providing use-case-driven program examples and candidate plans. In design workshops (N=7 educators), we identifed design goals to maxi­ mize instructors’ efciency in plan identifcation by optimizing interaction with this LLM-generated content. Our resulting tool, PLAID, enables instructors to access a corpus of relevant programs to inspire plan identifcation, compare code snippets to assist plan refnement, and facilitates them in structuring code snippets into plans. We evaluated PLAID in a within-subjects user study (N=12 educators) and found that PLAID led to lower cognitive demand and increased productivity compared to the state-of-the-art.

To address this gap, we used an Activity Theory framework to examine how developers with visual impairments interact with AI coding assistants. For this purpose, we conducted a study where developers who are visually impaired completed a series of programming tasks using a gener­ ative AI coding assistant. We uncovered that, while participants found the AI assistant benefcial and reported signifcant advan­ tages, they also highlighted accessibility challenges. Specifcally, the AI coding assistant often exacerbated existing accessibility barriers and introduced new challenges. For example, it overwhelmed users with an excessive number of suggestions, leading developers who are visually impaired to express a desire for “AI timeouts.” Addition­ ally, the generative AI coding assistant made it more difcult for developers to switch contexts between the AI-generated content and their own code. Despite these challenges, participants were optimistic about the potential of AI coding assistants to transform the coding experience for developers with visual impairments.

Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navi­ gating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM’s default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program de­ sign through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and iden­ tifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM.

We explored various difuser materials in terms of visual and mechanical properties. We correct the distortions of the volumetric graphics projected on elastic oscillating difusers and propose a design space for FlexiVol, enabling various gestures and actions through direct interaction techniques.

Yet, a major limitation is that they present data at a fixed, low level of abstraction which can overload the user with irrelevant details. In contrast, human drawings of data structures use many illustrative visual abstrac­ tions to show the most useful information. We attempt to bridge the gap by surveying 80 programmer-produced diagrams to develop a mechanical approach for capturing visual abstraction, termed ab­ straction moves. An abstraction move selects data objects of interest, and then revisualizes, simplifies, or annotates them. We implement these moves as a diagramming language for JavaScript code, named Chisel, and show that it can effectively reproduce 78 out of the 80 surveyed diagrams. In a preliminary study with four CS educators, we evaluate its usage and discover potential contexts of use.

However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efcient method to create training labels with a series of human-defned labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difculties of defning complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to defne key events by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These defnitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi- supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the efectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.

In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of color and opacity on depth order perception across eight colors, three opacity levels, and various layer orders and arrangements. Our inferential analysis shows that both color hue and opacity significantly influ­ ence depth order perception, with the effectiveness depending on their interaction. We also derived 12 features for predictive analysis, achieving the best mean accuracy of 80.72% and mean F1 score of 87.75%, with opacity assigned to the front layer as the top feature for most models.

This study explores how immersive embodied VR biography enhances intercultural empathy and understanding of displaced cultural objects. We took the famous Chinese paint­ ing, the Admonitions Scroll, housed at the British Museum as an example to design an Immersive Biography in VR. We conducted an empirical study with 24 participants from source and non-source communities. Findings suggested that interacting with biographical narratives of displaced cultural objects in a personified embodied way can effectively promote intercultural empathy and understand­ ing. Additionally, simulated intercultural scenarios and dialogues with personified cultural objects fostered intercultural empathy in both groups, with a stronger effect observed in non-source com­ munities due to differences in cultural identity and personal con­ nections. Our study provided the potential and practical insights of immersive technologies to inspire intercultural communication for displaced cultural objects. ∗Corresponding authors Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

To address this gap, we developed an inter­ active platform that served as a data collection tool for exploring public views on AI, including their fears, hopes, and overall sense of hopefulness. We made the platform available to 330 participants representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, sex, ethnic­ ity, and political leaning, and compared their views with those of 100 AI infuencers identifed by Time magazine. The public fears AI getting out of control, while infuencers emphasize regulation, seemingly to defect attention from their alleged focus on monetiz­ ing AI’s potential. Interestingly, the views of AI infuencers from underrepresented groups such as women and people of color often difer from the views of underrepresented groups in the public.

Due to fewer social connections and cultural adaptation, they face negative emotions such as loneliness and depression. While reminiscence- based interventions have been used to improve older adults’ psy­ chological well-being, challenges such as the lack of tangible mate­ rials and limited social resources constrain the feasibility of tradi­ tional reminiscence approaches for older drifters. To address this challenge, we designed RemiHaven, a personalized reminiscence support tool based on a two-phase formative study. It integrates “In-Town” and “Out-of-Town” peer agents to enhance personaliza­ tion, engagement, and emotional resonance in the reminiscence process powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

To explore, we conducted a field study on handover and the associated information work, which included 40 visits and 75 hours of observation and interviews with doctors in a metropolitan emergency department (ED). Beyond information exchange, we found that handovers highlight doctors' proactive approach by anticipating information needs, managing uncertainties arising from dynamic information, and developing patient care plans through multiple contingencies. Expanding on the idea of handover as a multifaceted process rather than a single event, we reinforce existing calls for greater flexibility emphasising that the ascertainment of pertinent information is an ongoing, adaptive process. This work demonstrates that deciding what constitutes relevant information is a priori indeterminate when designing information systems and support tools in environments such as EDs.

The artists navigate the opportunities and risks involved in blending 3D printing with Pueblo pottery. In our analysis, we introduce and examine three aspects of digital fabrica­ tion that impact professional practice: the practical, creative and conceptual. Practically, a digital fabrication machine may improve or worsen efficiency. Creatively, a machine can both expand and constrain the kinds of work artists can make. Finally, a machine can be conceptually significant; the use of the machine can change what a piece means and how it is perceived. We found that clay 3D ∗ printers: 1) are labor intensive to operate and do not improve effi­ ciency; 2) can present new and compelling creative opportunities; 3) are conceptually fraught.

In this work, we argue that we can extract insights on how to design effective, immersive reflection for XRLEs from the expertise of escape room game masters (GMs) who regularly pro­ vide reflective hints and prompts in complex, immersive problem solving environments. To explore what we can learn from GMs, we conducted exploratory semi-structured interviews with 13 escape room GMs and, via iterative open coding, captured their best prac­ tices in how they provide hints and give nudges to escape room players. From these results, we present a foundation and model of how GMs observe and intervene and discuss implications for XRLE-based reflection.

We conducted a series of nine generative participatory workshops with 15 educators to explore, design and seek feedback on the Ethics Refexivity Canvas as a pedagogical resource. The canvas makes the educator and learner positionality explicit to develop ethical sensitivity, sensitise and situate a pedagogical plan, and iterate and adapt over time. However, our fndings suggest that educators experience tensions, depending on their pedagogical approach. We contribute insight on how resources can align with education work in HCI, help educators refect on a plurality of approaches to ethics, use accessible language to stimulate curiosity towards ethics, and provide scafolding to operationalize collaborative and personal exploration.

The most critical phase in the lifecycle of a home router is perhaps the initial setup intended for users to complete. Yet, the mindset and behavior of users during this process remain under-explored. In a comprehensive online survey of 392 participants across sev­ eral regions, we find that router settings and user behavior vary significantly between China and English-speaking countries, influ­ enced by factors like IT background, age, gender, and education. A majority of participants go through the configuration of their own routers, but many also admit keeping the default settings and are not actively maintaining their router firmware up-to-date, leaving security vulnerabilities unfixed. We estimate that 91% of participant routers run with default settings, which should push router manufacturers to focus on safe defaults.

Given how naturally sketching comes to humans, we believe untapped potential exists in being able to sim­ ply draw commands onto a user interface. In this paper, we present results of an elicitation study about expressing common operations in spreadsheets through sketching. Spreadsheets are an interesting class of applications because they are widely used, support complex data and operations, and are available on touch-enabled devices. Our results show that despite considerable variation in syntactic details, participants gravitate towards recurring patterns (e.g., en­ closures and arrows, examples and cross-references, and temporal sequences of strokes). The sketch patterns we identified can be a first step towards developing interpreters of sketched commands, and thus enable new means of interacting with spreadsheets and other applications.

In two online experiments, we examined how LLM-based search affects behavior compared to traditional search and explored ways to reduce over- reliance on incorrect LLM-based output. Participants assigned to LLM-based search completed tasks more quickly, with fewer but more complex queries, and reported a more satisfying experience. While decision accuracy was comparable when the LLM was correct, users overrelied on incorrect information when the model erred. In a second experiment, a color-coded highlighting system helped users detect errors, improving decision accuracy without affecting other outcomes. These findings suggest that LLM-based search tools have promise as decision aids but also highlight the importance of effectively communicating uncertainty to mitigate overreliance.

While these platforms can support users’ sense of safety, they can also fuel a local culture of policing and lateral surveillance, which disproportionately impacts racialized and unhoused members of the community. In contrast, the theory and practice of Transformative Justice was developed to ensure the safety of those populations who are constructed to be dangerous by society. We conducted a case study of a neighborhood social work program in Jackson Grove, Atlanta to understand the design implications of a Transformative Justice-oriented approach to neighborhood safety. Our findings highlight an opportunity for designers to reconceptualize safety from merely protecting users towards: 1) meeting the basic needs of a community, and 2) building relationships to support accountability.

Neurodivergent people, often left out by existing accessibility technologies, develop their own ways of navigating normative expectations. GAI offers new opportunities for access, but it is important to understand how neurodivergent “power users”—successful early adopters—engage with it and the challenges they face. Further, we must understand how marginal­ ization and intersectional identities influence their interactions with GAI. Our autoethnography, enhanced by privacy-preserving GAI-based diaries and interviews, reveals the intricacies of using GAI to navigate normative environments and expectations. Our findings demonstrate how GAI can both support and complicate tasks like code-switching, emotional regulation, and accessing in­ formation. We show that GAI can help neurodivergent users to reclaim their agency in systems that diminish their autonomy and self-determination. However, challenges such as balancing authen­ tic self-expression with societal conformity, alongside other risks, create barriers to realizing GAI’s full potential for accessibility. ∗Both authors contributed equally to this research.

While many tools have been proposed to automate or facilitate data wrangling, they often misinterpret user intent, especially in complex tasks. We propose Dango, a mixed-initiative multi-agent system for data wrangling. Compared to existing tools, Dango enhances user communication of intent by: (1) allowing users to demonstrate on multiple tables and use natural language prompts in a conversation interface, (2) enabling users to clarify their intent by answering LLM-posed multiple-choice clarification questions, and (3) providing multiple forms of feedback such as step-by-step NL explanations and data provenance to help users evaluate the data wrangling scripts. We conducted a within-subjects user study (n=38) and demonstrated that Dango’s features can significantly improve intent clarification, accuracy, and efficiency in data wrangling. Furthermore, we demonstrated the generalizability of Dango by applying it to a broader set of data wrangling tasks.

However, empirical investigations of how concepts from cognitive science can aid the design of XAI are lacking. Based on insights from cognitive science, we propose a framework of explanatory modes to analyze how people frame explanations, whether mechanistic, teleologi­ cal, or counterfactual. Using the complex safety-critical domain of autonomous driving, we conduct an experiment consisting of two studies on (i) how people explain the behavior of a vehicle in 14 unique scenarios (𝑁1 = 54) and (ii) how they perceive these expla­ nations (𝑁2 = 382), curating the novel Human Explanations for Autonomous Driving Decisions (HEADD) dataset. Our main find­ ing is that participants deem teleological explanations significantly better quality than counterfactual ones, with perceived teleology being the best predictor of perceived quality. Based on our results, we argue that explanatory modes are an important axis of analysis when designing and evaluating XAI and highlight the need for a principled and empirically grounded understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of explanation.

An increasing number of AI literacy studies aim to enhance students’ competencies in understanding, using, and criti­ cally evaluating AI systems. However, despite the vulnerabilities faced by students from underserved communities—due to factors such as socioeconomic status, gender, and race—these students re­ main underrepresented in existing research. To address this gap, this study focuses on leveraging the cultural capital that students acquire from their communities’ unique history and culture for AI literacy education. Education researchers have demonstrated that identifying and mobilizing cultural capital is an efective strategy for educating these populations. Through collaboration with 26 students from underserved communities—including those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, female, or people of color—this paper identifes three types of cultural capital relevant to AI literacy education: 1) resistant capital, 2) communal capital, and 3) creative capital. The study also emphasizes that collaborative relationships between researchers and students are crucial for mobilizing cultural capital in AI literacy education research.

To understand the role of humor in AAC and the challenges and experiences of delivering humor with AAC, we conducted seven qualitative interviews with AAC users. Based on these insights and the lead author’s firsthand experience as an AAC user, we designed four AI-powered interfaces to assist in delivering well-timed humorous comments during ongoing conver­ sations. Our user study with five AAC users found that when timing is critical (e.g., delivering a humorous comment), AAC users are willing to trade agency for efficiency—contrasting prior research where they hesitated to delegate decision-making to AI.

GenieWizard supports user-desired command discovery early in the implementation pro­ cess, streamlining the development process. GenieWizard uses an LLM to generate potential user interactions and parse these interac­ tions into a form that can be used to discover the missing features for developers. Our evaluations showed that GenieWizard can reli­ ably simulate user interactions and identify missing features. Also, in a study (N = 12), we demonstrated that developers using Ge- nieWizard can identify and implement 42% of the missing features of multimodal apps compared to only 10% without GenieWizard.

A key element of PM, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), uses genetic data to predict an individual’s disease risk. Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identi­ fied ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed ∗ design implications for a responsible PRS framework. To address the complexities of PRS and enhance broader PM practices, we introduce the term Human-Precision Medicine Interaction (HPMI), which integrates, adapts, and extends HCI approaches to better meet these challenges.

Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in GenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking.

However, there is a growing disparity between the users’ perceptions of achievable security and privacy and the actual limi­ tations of such services. In a large-scale, multi-step mixed methods study, we holistically investigated the degree to which 78 consumer VPN providers support or undermine proper mental models for their products and services. We collected search queries from 300 participants - coming from five countries across four continents - to identify suitable VPN providers and, subsequently their secu­ rity and privacy promises. Among VPN providers’ statements, a large share contains misleading or false information, and more than half do not mention any threat agent at all.

Responding to the absence of overarching guid­ ance for moving beyond traditional aesthetics, this paper systemat­ ically reviews more-than-human aesthetic perspectives within and beyond HCI and design.

However, the potential usefulness of a new technology does not guarantee its adoption. This paper presents a case study in the adoption of 3D printing as an accessible format for BLV education in Australia and New Zealand. Over the last six years, a community- driven research project engaged in awareness raising, created a community of practice and developed guidelines for the use of 3D printing in education. We evaluate the success of the project using an Implementation Science lens with the RE-AIM framework and identify the key factors for successful adoption.

Our study deepens under­ standings of fertility tracker data sharing and presents co-created mechanisms to enhance user agency over their data in intimate contexts. To achieve this, we first analysed the network transmis­ sions from eight fertility tracker products, observing that many data transmissions appear to be tied to particular uses of the tracker and that the products communicate with endpoints associated with various organisations across different countries. This raises con- cerns about how intimate data is governed, used, and shared. To understand user attitudes towards data sharing in intimate con- texts, we then conducted a survey exploring factors influencing user data sharing preferences. Our findings reveal that users desire transparency and control mechanisms and that their willingness to share data is influenced by contextual factors, including the third parties involved, the purposes of data collection, and the sensitivity of the data.

This might mean capturing communication information about verbal (e.g. speech, chat messages), or non-verbal exchanges (e.g. body language, gestures, tone of voice) and using this to mediate – and potentially improve – communication. However, such tracking has implications for user experience and raises wider concerns (e.g. privacy).

This paper reports on a series of asset-based engagements with digital inclusion practitioners in the North East of England. These engagements explored the values, assets, and needs comprising their practices and used these in­ sights as design material to ideate strategies for future intervention.

However, chefs’ creative use of this sonic interactivity as a new “ingredient” in their culinary practices remains underexplored. In response, we conducted an empirical study with six pairs of chefs and diners utilizing SoniCream, an ice cream cone that plays digital sounds while consuming. Through exploration, creation, collaboration, and reflection, we identified four themes concerning culinary creativity, dining experience, in­ teractive sonic gastronomy deployment, and chef-diner interplay. Building on the discussions at the intersection of these themes, we derived four design implications for creating interactive systems that could support chefs’ culinary creativity, thereby enriching dining experiences. Ultimately, our work aims to help interaction designers fully incorporate chefs’ perspectives into HFI research. CCS Concepts • Human-centered computing → Interaction design.

Participants reported how com­ fortable they felt sharing fitness data, commented on whether they believed their identity impacted this comfort, and brainstormed several data sharing risks and a possible mitigation for each risk. For each surveyed dimension of social identity, we find one or more reliable effects on participants’ level of comfort sharing fitness data, specifically when considering institutional groups like employers, insurers, and advertisers. Further, 64% of participants indicate at least one of their identity characteristics informs their comfort. We also find evidence that the perceived risks of sharing fitness data vary by identity, but do not find evidence of difference in the strategies used to manage these risks.

The downstream automated discourse classifiers of tutor talk were correspondingly less accurate for Black tutors when presented with ASR input. As a result, although Black tutors demonstrated higher-quality discourse on human transcripts, this trend was not evident on ASR transcripts.

This paper describes a re­ search through design investigation into a paradigm of constraint- based design, founded on the practical and perceived constraints of solar-powered internet. Our intention is not to examine individual consumer as a site for sustainable transition, but the industries and industry practitioners at the interface with consumers. We employed strategies that included optimisation as a form of min- imisation, visibility as a means to mark existing absence, offloading from automation, and the design of dead-ends. We discuss the chal­ lenges in learning to design against the cornucopian paradigm. While the overall vision of an internet powered by the sun seems at once desirable and achievable, the pursuit of a constraints-based interaction design highlights the desire to confirm the dominant paradigm of abundance.

This study evaluates one avenue that works against these efforts: the interaction between recruiter work practices and algorithmic recruiting tools. Through interviews and cognitive walkthroughs with fifteen recruiters, we find that recruiters—often under dead­ lines and quotas—develop shortcuts (e.g., computer science degrees and employment at prestigious companies) for identifying “typi­ cal” software engineers (one of the most sought-after roles in the field) who have a higher chance of being successfully hired. We then analyze the results of searches like those recruiters often con­ duct in one commonly-used recruitment tool. We see recruiters’ shortcuts also reflected in these results: candidates with computer science degrees, living in expensive tech hubs, and employed at high-profile tech companies are disproportionately favored. Given the lack of demographic diversity in software engineering at presti­ gious companies, we assert that algorithmically preferencing these factors helps to reify existing stereotypes, impacting the diversity of candidates who are ultimately hired.

While technologies for dementia care have advanced, there remains a gap in creating solutions that are directly informed by the experiences of people living with dementia and support their individuality. In collaboration with the specialist arts organisation Bright Shadow CIO, our work involves engaging people living with dementia in the design process. Over five weeks of co-design ses­ sions, 44 participants worked alongside artists to craft four physical boxes that represent “meaningful places.” The physical boxes were then transformed into VR environments, allowing participants to immerse themselves in and interact with their creations from a first-person perspective. Our findings demonstrate that VR alone is insufficient in dementia care. For VR to be meaningful, it must be be part of a broader intervention that includes trust-building, sensory engagement, and creative involvement. Within this process, art- making serves as both a method and medium, providing a means of ∗ self-expression and connection to identity. Our findings challenge conventional approaches to dementia-focused VR, advocating for a shift toward inclusive and care-driven technology design.

Pre­ vious research has shown that this rigid turn-taking pattern lacks interactivity and initiative, limiting the flexible communication between older adults and voice agents. To address these issues and create a more natural conversational voice agent, we first con­ ducted a formative study to identify common usage of interruption in the natural conversations of older adults. We then designed an LLM-powered Barge-in agent that supports interruption and backchannel. Our within-subject exploratory study showed that participants felt that conversations with Barge-in agents were more natural, engaging, and fluent than with the No barge-in agent.

Without adequate emotional sensi­ tivity, the robot sometimes responded inappropriately, requiring researchers to intervene in the interaction to address misunder­ standings. To understand how to better address these challenges, we conducted a follow-up co-design workshop with 7 older adults to explore how the robot could better support managing bittersweet emotions. Through reflexive thematic analysis of the two studies, this paper identifies factors that trigger bittersweet emotions during reminiscence with a robot and provides strategies for technology to manage these emotions during such interactions.

Through a qualitative study with mutual aid volunteers in the United States, we found that mutual aid groups’ values, such as solidarity, security, and co-production, are prioritized as they navigate adopting technology. However, while technology can streamline logistics and enhance visibility for mutual aid groups, we argue that the adoption of existing tech­ nologies and conventions of practice can erode opportunities for building solidarity, present challenges for accountability, and exac­ erbate pre-existing social exclusions. We argue that these tensions emerge not simply as a mismatch between values and technical design, but as systematic outcomes of adopting tools that embed different political assumptions and points of access.

However, visual analytics using DR often face unreliability, stemming from factors such as inherent distortions in DR projections. This unreliability can lead to analytic insights that misrepresent the underlying data, potentially resulting in misguided decisions. To tackle these reliability challenges, we review 133 papers that address the unreliability of visual analytics using DR. Through this review, we contribute (1) a workflow model that describes the interaction between analysts and machines in visual analytics using DR, and (2) a taxonomy that identifies where and why reliability issues arise within the workflow, along with existing solutions for addressing them. Our review reveals ongoing challenges in the field, whose significance and urgency are validated by five expert researchers. This review also finds that the current research landscape is skewed toward developing new DR techniques rather than their interpretation or evaluation, where we discuss how the HCI community can contribute to broadening this focus.

However, the potential downstream impacts of LLM-based edtech remain understudied. Prior attempts to map the risks of LLMs have not been tailored to education specifcally, even though it is a unique domain in many respects: from its population (students are often children, who can be es­ pecially impacted by technology) to its goals (providing the correct answer may be less important for learners than understanding how to arrive at an answer) to its implications for higher-order skills that generalize across contexts (e.g., critical thinking and collaboration). We conducted semi-structured interviews with six edtech providers representing leaders in the K-12 space, as well as a diverse group of 23 educators with varying levels of experience with LLM-based edtech.

This assumption guided the design of the co-design workshops, which included diary studies followed by co-design sessions with eight dyads. However, our results from reflexive thematic analysis chal­ lenge the initial view that relationship dynamics follow a single persona or outcome. Instead, the diversity in relationship dynam­ ics led to multiple design outcomes, highlighting the need for HCI researchers to consider care dynamics when designing and conduct­ ing research studies for care partnerships. Researchers can structure and create iterative co-design workshops to accommodate these dynamics by incorporating ongoing reflection on the dyad’s rela­ tionship dynamics and the researchers’ influence throughout all co-design stages.

However, the cognitive load associated with QSs has hindered their adoption in digital surveys for collective decision-making. We introduce a two-phase “organize-then-vote” QS to reduce cognitive load. As interface de­ sign significantly impacts survey results and accuracy, our design scaffolds survey takers’ decision-making while managing the cog­ nitive load imposed by QS. In a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study on public resource allotment, we compared our interface with a traditional text interface across a QS with 6 (short) and 24 (long) options. Two-phase interface participants spent more time per op­ tion and exhibited shorter voting edit distances. We qualitatively observed shifts in cognitive effort from mechanical operations to constructing more comprehensive preferences.

Through a think-aloud study in which participants use an LLM-infused application to answer objective questions, we identify several features of LLM responses that shape users’ reliance: explanations (supporting details for answers), incon­ sistencies in explanations, and sources. Through a large-scale, pre­ registered, controlled experiment (N=308), we isolate and study the effects of these features on users’ reliance, accuracy, and other mea­ sures. We find that the presence of explanations increases reliance on both correct and incorrect responses.

Generative AI-powered writing tools can enhance this process but may also disrupt the natural fow of writ­ ing, such as when using LLMs for complex tasks like restructuring content across diferent sections or creating smooth transitions. We introduce Script&Shift, a layered interface paradigm designed to minimize these disruptions by aligning writing intents with LLM capabilities to support diverse content development and rhetorical strategies. By bridging envisioning, semantic, and articulatory dis­ tances, Script&Shift’s interactions allow writers to leverage LLMs for various content development tasks (scripting) and experiment with diverse organization strategies while tailoring their writing for diferent audiences (shifting). This approach preserves creative control while encouraging divergent and iterative writing. Our evaluation shows that Script&Shift enables writers to creatively and efciently incorporate LLMs while preserving a natural fow of composition.

Current definitions of collaborative robots provide a pragmatic starting point for es­ tablishing safety guidelines, choosing operating parameters, and implementing organisational changes, but remain predicated on technological conceptions that prioritise a conscious split between people and robots, with the surrounding world as merely a physical site for interaction. In this paper, we take a postphenomenological perspective on robots in an investigation of human-world relations that robots can give rise to. This perspective can help elucidate the nature of such relations in a design process. Our investigation is anchored in an 8-month research study that aimed to, first, identify opportunities for a robot integration within a medical manufac­ turing facility and, second, facilitate a design and implementation process of a proof-of-concept robotic system in collaboration with workers. The paper contributes with an empirically anchored post- phenomenological analysis of how human-world relations played out in the design process of a collaborative robotic system.

To examine preschoolers’ engagement in behavior tracking with their parents, we conducted a 4-week deployment study with 14 DUFS patients (4–6 years) and their parents as part of DUFS management. The majority of patient participants enthusiastically engaged in semi-automated data capture, driven by their initial interest in Fluid- Track.

This paper provides empirical evidence on the construction and organizational management of technical accuracy, demonstrating how technology companies’ preoccupa­ tion with such values leads to harm. Drawing on nine months of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in China, we document how AI trainers’ everyday work practices, challenges, and harms stem from clients’ demands for high levels of technical accuracy. We introduce the concept of precision labor to unpack the labor dimension of constructing and performing accuracy in AI training. This concept highlights the hidden and excessive labor required to reconcile the ambiguity and uncertainty involved in this process. We argue that precision labor offers a new lens to illuminate three critical aspects of AI training: 1) the negative health and financial impacts of hidden and excessive labor on AI workers; 2) emerging harms, including workers’ subordinate roles to machines and financial precarity; and 3) a conceptual contribution to contexts beyond AI training. This contribution re-centers arbitrariness in technical production, highlights the excessive demands of precision labor, and examines the legitimization of labor and harm.

We identify five sources of normativity which form conventions of misuse: tradi­ tional practices, educational institutions, industry norms, online communities, and tools themselves. We surface why artists defy norms and misuse creative software by exploring how software apathy affects tool engagement, how tool genealogies and personal histories impact artists’ practices, and how artists prioritize practi­ cal and professional needs during the creative process. Alongside traditional definitions, we offer artists’ individual perspectives on what misuse means and its relevance to their creative practice. By understanding artists as “mis-users,” we present an opportunity to revise how we design for using and misusing creativity support tools.

In this paper, we seek to understand the potential that people with memory concerns see in tracking. We conducted interviews with 29 participants with concerns about their memory and engaged in an affective writing approach. We find a range of potentials that can be traced to how participants are already self-tracking. Emotions associated with these potentials vary: from acceptance to resistance, and positive anticipation to aversion. Participants are emotionally motivated to foreclose possibilities in some instances and keep them open in others. While individual and unique, potential is structured by forces that include individual routines, relationships with others, and macro-level institutions and cultural contexts. We reflect on these findings in the context of research on self-tracking with older adults, designing with ambiguity, and forces that structure the experience of living with memory concerns.

As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and chal­ lenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale software troubleshooting, we propose a workfow for asynchronous hard­ ware troubleshooting: SplatOverfow. SplatOverfow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOver­ fow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. A scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user’s hardware registered onto the hardware’s CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverfow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user’s workspace. Workfows contain­ ing multiple instructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments. In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverfow, the work­ fows it enables, and its utility to diferent kinds of users.

We assessed people’s attitudes towards dementia following convers­ ing with a chatbot presented as either neurotypical or simulating dementia symptoms. While neither the chatbot’s presentation nor the framing of participants’ future selves impacted attitudes toward dementia, it influenced participants’ experiences. When framed as future selves, the chatbot evoked a strong emotional connection, leading to reflection on aging, particularly with the chatbot simulat­ ing dementia symptoms. Participants interacting with the chatbot framed as a stranger with simulated symptoms often felt frustrated, especially when they had a task-oriented mindset. Chatbots can be promising tools for prompting reflections on challenging futures, such as dementia, although their effectiveness varies due to the tensions between simulated cognitive decline and expectations for effective communication.

Despite VR technology has already shown its potential in education, existing research has not addressed the crucial learning component of repli­ cating the shooting process. Moreover, the limited functionality of traditional controllers hinder the fulfillment of the educational requirements. Therefore, we developed VAction VR system, com­ bining high-fidelity virtual environments with a custom-designed controller to simulate the real-world camera operation experience.

Previous studies often treat online harms and benefits as outcomes of parental mediation, overlooking how these factors affect parental mediation or how these effects vary with parents’ self-efficacy. To address these gaps, we surveyed 285 parents and found that perceived content informativeness value and content- inherent harm increase mediation, while entertainment value and creator trustworthiness decrease it. Parents’ self-efficacy—digital literacy and confidence in understanding their children’s consump- tion—and children’s consumption frequency significantly moderate these effects. These findings lead us to discuss how parental media­ tion differs between traditional media and social video platforms, where parents perform a more complex benefit-harm analysis due to competing effects of perceived harms and benefits. We propose strategies for enhancing parents’ self-efficacy and platform-parent collaboration in children’s online safety.

We conducted a study at a walk-in clinic with 45 patients who interacted with one of three conversational agents: a chatbot, a questionnaire, and a Wizard-of-Oz. We analyzed patients’ messages using metrics adapted from Grice’s maxims to assess the quality of information gathered at each conversation turn. We found that the Wizard and LLM were more successful than the questionnaire because they modified questions and asked follow-ups when participants provided unsatisfactory answers. However, the LLM did not ask nearly as many follow-up questions as the Wizard, particularly when participants provided unclear answers. 1 Introduction CCS Concepts • Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in HCI; • Applied computing → Health informatics.",0.06666666666666665,False,"analysis of, user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0001270771026611328,

Estimates from Bayesian regression models suggest that limiting spatial knowledge of the PE increases spatial presence initially but amplifies the detrimental effect of obstacle collisions.

In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing that our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.

Federal regulatory interventions turn to datafication and automation to reduce the harms of this widely unpopular process shown to delay vital treatments and create immense administrative burden for healthcare providers and patients.

However, as AI systems integrate into domain-specific workflows, exhaustive benchmarking can become impractical, often resulting in silent or minimally communicated updates. This raises critical questions: Can users notice these up­ dates? What cues do they rely on to distinguish between models? How do such changes affect their behavior and task performance? We address these questions through two studies in the context of facial recognition for historical photo identification: an online ex­ periment examining users’ ability to detect model updates, followed by a diary study exploring perceptions in a real-world deployment.

However, the differences between LLM-generated and human- written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM- generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. clichés, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, build­ ing on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.

To explore this, we examined the effects of repeated exposure to delays during point-and-click tasks. Our findings demonstrate that longer system response delays significantly slow down users’ ac­ tions, even before they experience the delayed feedback from the current input.

This could hinder users from finding and fully adapting to the transfer function that is optimal for them. We propose a novel hardware-embedded transfer function technique that is expected to allow users to consistently experience the desired function even when device hardware or OS settings change. The technique (1) al­ lows users to define the desired function within the device firmware in physical units and (2) enables the firmware to cancel out the in­ fluence of OS-native functions and hardware setting perturbations, so that the uploaded function can persist regardless of the external environment. Through technical evaluation including transfer func­ tions of various shapes, we showed that the proposed technique has comparable robustness and accuracy to the conventional approach.

Micro-phenomenological interviews unpack the specific experiences of interviewees in fine-grained detail and have previously been acknowledged as a potent tool for Human- Computer Interaction Research. More recently, the method has been extended to comprise a structured analysis method to system­ atically analyse the temporal unfolding and qualitative dimensions of experiences captured by the interviews. This is the first paper demonstrating the combined use of interviews and analysis via a case in which they were employed to examine the experience of using WeUsedTo, a website for sharing experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On this basis, we discuss the potentials of the method for eliciting and understanding experiential aspects of inter­ active systems, particularly pertaining to embodiment, temporality, attention, agency, and the systemic nature of experience.

This paper introduces Flexible Inertial Poser (FIP), a novel motion- capturing system using daily garments with two elbow-attached flex sensors and four Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). To ad­ dress the inevitable sensor displacements in loose wearables which degrade joint tracking accuracy significantly, we identify the dis­ tinct characteristics of the flex and inertial sensor displacements and develop a Displacement Latent Diffusion Model and a Physics- informed Calibrator to compensate for sensor displacements based on such observations, resulting in a substantial improvement in mo­ tion capture accuracy. We also introduce a Pose Fusion Predictor to ∗ enhance multimodal sensor fusion. Extensive experiments demon­ strate that our method achieves robust performance across varying body shapes and motions, significantly outperforming SOTA IMU approaches with a 19.5% improvement in angular error, a 26.4% improvement in elbow angular error, and a 30.1% improvement in positional error.

Reassurance has been identified as a key factor in improving engagement. Our study explored how cancer patients seek reassurance through a Patient Public Involve­ ment workshop with former patients. This involved developing personas for participants to navigate reassurance scenarios and share their post-operative experiences. Based on this, we co-created a reassurance journey map to illustrate when reassurance is needed, the behaviours patients use to seek it, and how it can be effectively provided. Our findings highlight three key design principles: the limitations of digital technology in offering reassurance, the person- alised nature of reassurance, and the need for holistic integration. These are intended to inform the design of reassurance-focused RPM systems that better support cancer patients during home re­ covery. Practical design recommendations are also provided for developers and clinicians.

This study explores the role of GenAI in shaping perceptions of AI's contribution and how these perceptions influence both creators’ internal assessments of their work and their anticipation of external evaluators’ assessments. Our research develops and empirically tests a structural model through a between-subjects experiment, revealing that the role GenAI plays in the work process significantly impacts perceived enhancements in work quality and effort relative to human input.

Through interviews and a workshop with 14 stakeholders involved in a Dutch national public awareness campaign, we found that while stakeholders recognized the validity of these concerns, they opted to continue the campaign with minor modifications while expecting regulatory changes to resolve the observed problem. Their justifi­ cations reveal an institutional incentive structure that overlooks well-documented user realities in security and privacy HCI research. This raises important considerations for the design and delivery of such support strategies.

However, an empirical understand­ ing of industry practitioner implementation of accessible guidelines within mainstream commercial applications is currently lacking. This review addresses this gap by categorising all accessibility fea­ tures presented at a software-level in 330 of the most used virtual reality applications released between 2016 to 2023 on the Steam, Meta, Oculus, Viveport, and SideQuest platforms. Results suggest a growing lack of interaction customisation, with the number of applications allowing for alternative inputs and physical posture fexibility decreasing. Meanwhile, display output settings, such as text font resizing and colourblind alterations, are almost completely absent. Our fndings highlight the evolution in the implementation of accessible features in virtual reality software, contributing to a representative overview of practitioner decisions, and acting as a catalyst towards the establishment of industry-wide guidelines.

Augmented reality (AR) can bridge the gap between the inside and outside world, and thus can resolve the issue of attention switches. In a mixed methods simulator study with 19 pilots, we tested an AR application that integrated invisible and hard-to-see aeronautical data and navi­ gation features with the visible world. Results show that the AR tool enhances and accelerates orientation, and can result in flight trajectories being more accurate with AR than without AR.

EQB3IRQS,Efficient Management of LLM-Based Coaching Agents' Reasoning While Maintaining Interaction Quality and Speed,"Göldi, Andreas; Rietsche, Roman; Ungar, Lyle",Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2025,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713606,"LLM-based agents improve upon standalone LLMs, which are opti­ mized for immediate intent-satisfaction, by allowing the pursuit of more extended objectives, such as helping users over the long term. To do so, LLM-based agents need to reason before responding. For complex tasks like personalized coaching, this reasoning can be in­ formed by adding relevant information at key moments, shifting it in the desired direction. However, the pursuit of objectives beyond interaction quality may compromise this very quality. Moreover, as the depth and informativeness of reasoning increase, so do the number of tokens required, leading to higher latency and cost. This study investigates how an LLM-based coaching agent can adjust its reasoning depth using a discrepancy mechanism that signals how much reasoning efort to allocate based on how well the objective is being met. Our discrepancy-based mechanism constrains reasoning to better align with alternative objectives, reducing cost roughly tenfold while minimally impacting interaction quality.
